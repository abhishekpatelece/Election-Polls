Consider candidates are not participating in the voting.
Enter the no. of voters and candidates.
Declaring an string array1 to store the name of candidates.
Declaring an dynamic array to store the number of votes of ith candidates at ith index.
Store all the votes in string array2.
Compare element of string array 2 with ith element of string array1 if equal then increase the value by 1 at ith index in dynamic array.
find the index of maximum value in dynamic array and the same index in string array1 will give us the name of candidate,store the name in temp.
if in dynamic array any other value equal to max then find the index and find the name at same index in string array1.
if name comes after temp in dictionary then temp=name
winner of the election=temp
